# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a two-player Tic Tac Toe game in Python played via the console. Players take turns choosing positions (1â€“9) on a number pad-like board. The game checks for wins, ties, and valid moves. It announces the result and offers a replay option, resetting the board for each round with smooth player switching and clear display.
